            <b>Why create this website?</b>
            <p>As I have learned Lakȟótiyapi, I’ve noticed that it can be quite expensive to learn. I’ve probably spent
                around $150 dollars on learning materials in the past couple years. I’m fortunate enough to have that
                sort of money to spend, but some people don’t. I’m creating this website to have a place that
                comprehensively teaches Lakȟótiyapi year-round for free. </p>
            <hr/>
            <b>Why have a podcast along with the website?</b>
            <p>Languages aren’t just written, they’re spoken. And in the case of Lakȟótiyapi, the language was spoken
                hundreds of years before it was ever written down on paper. In learning any language, it’s important to
                hear it spoken out loud. In addition, many people learn better when they have two sources of input;
                written and spoken. The website and podcast provide both.</p>
            <hr/>
            <b>What is taught here?</b>
            <p>My lessons mainly focus on grammar. Grammar is the blueprint necessary to continue building more and more
                complex, and more and more fluent sounding, sentences. Along with this, I also provide smaller lessons
                on vocabulary, and direct translations of old writings in Lakȟótiyapi. </p>
